1. Getting ucrypt :
  Fork ucrypt from github by using git clone git://github.com/tkunwar/ucrypt.git.

2. Building ucrypt
  ucrypt uses static build of libtomcrypt as the core library providing cryptograhy routines. It is 
  provided with the source of ucrypt. Though new versions of libtomcrypt may also compile correctly but they are not
  tested. 

  Also libtomcrypt provided was compiled at a  x64 machine so to get 32 bit builds of the library obtain the library
  for http://libtom.org and compile it with standard configuration. It should build just fine. Don's forget to copy the
  static library file "libtomcrypt.a" into directory "ucrypt". 

  Also make changes to Makefile-- remove -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 from the CFALGS. Rest every thing should work fine.

  Enjoy :)
