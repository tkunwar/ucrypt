ucrypt is a commandline tool which can be used for encrytping your files.
ucrypt is inspired by "aescrypt for linux" and uses some code directly from
aescrypt source, see aescrypt.com . It is a highly configurable tool and 
supports AES,BLOWFISH and CAST5 algorithms at present. However, 
as we move on, new features such as batch processing and support for more 
algorithms will be added.

ucrypt uses libtomcrypt as the core for cryptography rotuines. See more about
libtomcrypt at http://libtom.org .
