ucrypt is a commandline tool which can be used for encrytping your files.
ucrypt is inspired by "aescrypt for linux". It supports AES,BLOWFISH and 
CAST5 algorithms at present. However, as we move on, new features such as 
batch processing and support for more algorithms will be added.

ucrypt uses libtomcrypt as the core for cryptography rotuines. See more about
libtomcrypt at http://libtom.org .

Ucrypt is free as in everything. Do whatever you want with it but at
at your own risk.
